# Adapter Pattern
Adapter is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
Adapter is about creating an intermediary abstraction that translates, or maps, the old component to the new system. Clients call methods on the Adapter object which redirects them into calls to the legacy component. This strategy can be implemented either with inheritance or with aggregation.
